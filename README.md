The Pi learning game!

Test your memory and learn as many digits of Pi as your heart desires! You'll never use them, but reciting Pi is a great party trick. Or so I've heard from people who don't spend all their free time developing Pi memory games and actually attend parties.

**My project is live on Netlify!**

And you can go play it [here](https://pilon.netlify.com)!

## Motivation

From elementary school through high school I loved memorizing random numbers like Pi and composing songs out of their many wonderful digits with my friends. At my peak I had a full 314 digits of Pi memorized! Unfortunately, I have since dropped digits... In celebration of Pi Day (3/14/2020) and in an effort to relearn the digits I have lost, I built this app to retrain my memory!

From a technical standpoint, I wanted to use this as an opportunity to test `styled-components` integration with TypeScript as well as demonstrate for myself how well the React Context API replaces the need for Redux. This is also my first project leveraging Netlify.

I may continue to add little features here in there, but the MVP game portion of the app is complete!

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn lint`

Lints the app with ESLint.
